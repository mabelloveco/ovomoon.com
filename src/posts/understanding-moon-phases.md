# Understanding Moon Phases and Your Energy

The moon cycles through eight phases every month. Each phase brings a different emotional tone and energetic shift.  

- **New Moon**: Best for setting intentions.  
- **First Quarter**: Time for taking action.  
- **Full Moon**: Heightened energy, clarity, and release.  
- **Last Quarter**: Reflection and preparation.  

By aligning your activities with the moonâ€™s rhythm, you can improve timing for decisions and personal growth.
