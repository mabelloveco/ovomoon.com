# Building Rituals Around the New Moon

The new moon marks the beginning of the lunar cycle and is a powerful time for fresh starts.  

### Steps to create your ritual:
1. Write down clear, simple intentions.  
2. Light a candle or incense as a symbol of new energy.  
3. Repeat your intentions aloud to anchor them.  

Keep the ritual short and consistent. Over time, these practices create momentum toward your goals.
