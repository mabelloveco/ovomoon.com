# Understanding Moon Phases and Your Energy
*Published: 2025-09-06*

The moon moves through eight phases every month, and each one brings a shift in energy.  
The **New Moon** is a time of beginnings and intention-setting. The **First Quarter Moon** pushes you to take action.  
The **Full Moon** is the peak — emotions run high and clarity arrives. The **Last Quarter Moon** calls for release and letting go.

When you tune into these phases, you’ll notice patterns in your mood, motivation, and decisions. Aligning with the moon is a simple way to feel in sync with natural rhythms.
